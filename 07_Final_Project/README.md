## What to Submit?
By Dec. 10 (first version) and Dec. 14 (final version), you will need to email a .zip archive named `projectname.zip`, *where `projectname` should be replaced with the actual catkin_ws name of your project.*
	
The .zip archive should have the following directory structure:	

```
README.md
Images/	
code/projectname/	
	scripts/
	msg/
	srv/
	CMakeLists.txt
	package.xml
```		

- A sample README file [may be found here](README_template_for_final_report.md)
- `Images/` is a directory (folder) for storing the graphics for your README.
- `code/projectname/` is a directory for your ROS code.  Replace `projectname` with the name of your catkin package.
	- Within this directory you should have `CMakeLists.txt`, `package.xml`, a `scripts/` directory, most likely a `msg/` directory, and possibly a `srv/` directory (if your project uses services).  
- See `06_Followbot` for an example of the directory structure.
