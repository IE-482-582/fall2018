The python script `create_world.py` will convert a `.csv` file of x,y coordinates into a `.world` file containing a unit box located at each x,y coordinate.

## Instructions:

1. Open `sample_racetrack.xls` and edit the x,y coordinates.
2. Export the spreadsheet as `sample_racetrack.csv` **This is a "comma separated values" file**.  
3. Open a terminal and change directories to where the `create_world.py` script is saved.  Then:
   ```
   python create_world.py
   ```

After running the script, you'll see a file named `course_ubusername.world`.  You may rename this file as you like.
